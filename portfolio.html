				<p> My name is Joseph Doyle and im currently 15 years old. I was born and 
				raised here in Hawaii from a mixed of white and Fillipino family. Here at James Campbell I am a average 
				student with a 3.2 GPA.
				As of right now math is one of my strongest subjects but i'm looking to change that this year, 
				I would like to try to get more involve in multiple subjects more. 
				This being my sophmore year and apparently one of the most important years of High school
				My goal for this year is to strive for a 3.5 and be more involved in school than only playing High School basketball.</p>
